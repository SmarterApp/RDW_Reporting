  <CommonCoreStandardDescription><![CDATA[This column reflects the Common Core State Standard(s) associated with a test item. Test items may be associated with more than one standard.  Items that assess mathematical practices (problem solving, modeling and data analysis, and communicating reasoning) are also aligned to standards that describe the mathematical content with which students engage. For example, an item may ask students to communicate their reasoning when solving a problem about geometry or fractions.

For example, collect data from a random sample of students in your school on their favorite subject among math, science, and English. Estimate the probability that a randomly selected student from your school will favor science given that the student is in tenth grade. Do the same for other subjects and compare the results.]]></Description>
