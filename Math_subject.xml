  <CommonCoreStandardDescription><![CDATA[This column reflects the Common Core State Standard(s) associated with a test item. Test items may be associated with more than one standard.  Items that assess mathematical practices (problem solving, modeling and data analysis, and communicating reasoning) are also aligned to standards that describe the mathematical content with which students engage. For example, an item may ask students to communicate their reasoning when solving a problem about geometry or fractions.
