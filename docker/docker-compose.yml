# docker-compose specs for rdw reporting service with the configuration server
# running in a container and MySQL running natively (outside the containers).
#
# The following environment variables MUST be set before running this spec:
#
# DATAWAREHOUSE_HOST - host running mysql with rdw reporting schema initialized
# For mac developers running mysql natively, something like:
#   $ export DATAWAREHOUSE_HOST=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0)
# This value may have to be reset when you change networks.
#
# CONFIG_SERVICE_REPO - git repo url, e.g. https://gitlab.com/fairwaytech/sbac-config-repo.git
# GIT_USER - user with rights to access CONFIG_SERVICE_REPO
# GIT_PASSWORD - password for GIT_USER
#
# This configuration maps the config folder as outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md and the application.yml file from the config
# server local-docker profile points to that folder so developers should be able to reuse the saml.jks file
# (NOTE: developers may have to explicitly share the /opt folder in Docker, Preferences, File Sharing)
