# Grade 3
report.overall-achievement.grade.03.subject.ELA={0} took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the grade three California academic standards for English language arts/literacy and received an overall score that ranges from about 2000 to 3000. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.
