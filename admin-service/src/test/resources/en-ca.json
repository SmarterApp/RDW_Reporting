Test scores are on a vertical scale, meaning that scores for all grades are reported on a single continuous scale to reflect the increased expectations as students advance through the grades. The error band is included because test scores are estimates of student performance/achievement and come with a certain amount of measurement error. See the Interpretive Guide for additional information."
